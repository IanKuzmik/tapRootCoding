Welcome

This is all of the code that goes into building my resume website. 
[iankuzmik.tapRootCoding.com](https://iankuzmik.taprootcoding.com)

Other than some CSS and files that came with Fontello Font Icons, it's all written by me. Before transferring the relevant files to my actually web-host, I'm also minimizing the CSS and JS files for optimum efficiency. 

As with anything on my GitHub, feel free to recycle anything you see here for your own use.

And if you got here from one of my job applications, I appreciate your interest! Hope to hear back from you soon.
